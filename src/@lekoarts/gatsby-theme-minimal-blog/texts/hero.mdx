  I bring systems thinking and consistency to complex problems and help teams
  deliver faster in scale with fewer inconsistencies and technical blockers.

<Text as="div">
  I have built and scaled up multi-platform design systems across web, iOS, and
  Android with AI and MCP pipeline in mind resulting in the most optimal
  automation - partnering with engineers, designers, and PMs to create a
  pipeline for tokens, components, documentation, and governance into one
  continuous system. I focus on accessibility, quality, and simplicity -
  allowing teams to deliver design to code and to customers in a scalable and
  consistent manner.
