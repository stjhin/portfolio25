## üöÄ Hello World

### [Live Site](https://stjhin.com/)

- Forked from [LekoArts](https://github.com/LekoArts/gatsby-starter-minimal-blog)
- Things I used to create this: Gatsby JS, Github Copilot

## ‚úçÔ∏è Description

Welcome! This is an experiment of updating my portfolio in 2025 using Gatsby JS using just Github Copilot. I want to see how far I can push AI capabilities through this personal project. I know some front end development, but I am no way a developer. I do plan to learn how to create my backend using either Wordpress or Headless CMS such as Sanity, but probably not for this project.

## ‚ú® Getting Started

### 1. **Create a Gatsby site.**
