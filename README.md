## üöÄ Hello World

### [Live Site](https://stjhin.com/)

- Things I used to create this: Gatsby JS, Github Copilot
- Responsive Design
- Dark Mode/Light Mode
- Project Query with Tags

## ‚úçÔ∏è Description

Welcome! This is an experiment and also for me to update my portfolio in 2025 using Gatsby JS using just Github Copilot. I want to see how far I can push AI capabilities through this personal project. I know some front end development, but I am no way a developer. I do have future plan to learn how to create my backend using either Wordpress or Headless CMS such as Sanity, but probably not for this project.

## ‚ú® Content & Navigation

There is a top navigation of: Projects and external links to my [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/silvialy/) and [Github](https://github.com/stjhin). I plan to slowly update the Projects and add my own Projects.

### Infinity Design Sysytem

Used Figma MCP to create this for rapid prototyping and efficient dev hand-off.

### Mercury

NDA Project with multiple products for multiple platforms.

### Jupiter

NDA Project where I was consulted about 2 products for multiple stakeholders.

### Relae

NDA Project where I worked on internal tool.
